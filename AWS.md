# AWS
We're going to run this in AWS so we can use an instance with more memory but we want to save costs so let's

Create a keypair 
Make sure keypair's loaded on our machine and vscode is setup for remote-ssh to our instance
Start with a small instance type and setup our environment first
RockLinux 8
apt/yum updates
Git
Vscode remote
possibly small hard drive then increase
Lambda to shutdown instance, just to be safe
